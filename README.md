# Data-Visualization

## 1. What is the data that you chose? Why?

For this assignment, we will visualize social networking data using anonymized data from Facebook, 

The first file we will use, [edges.csv](https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015+type@asset+block/edges.csv), contains variables V1 and V2, which label the endpoints of edges in our network. Each row represents a pair of users in our graph who are Facebook friends. For a pair of friends A and B, edges.csv will only contain a single row -- the smaller identifier will be listed first in this row. From this row, we will know that A is friends with B and B is friends with A.

The second file, [users.csv](https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015+type@asset+block/users.csv), contains information about the Facebook users, who are the vertices in our network. This file contains the following variables:

In our visualizations, the vertices in our network will represent Facebook users and the edges will represent these users being Facebook friends with each other.

## 2. Did you use a subset of the data? If so, what was it?

Yes, I want to know what is the gender of the users with the highest degree in the graph?

## 3. Are there any particular aspects of your visualization to which you would like to bring attention?
